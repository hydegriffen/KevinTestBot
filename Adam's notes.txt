bot - the bot itself, used for sendText and such (probably don't touch)
chat_id - the chat_id where the message received came from, used in sendText, abstracted away from you
parsedCommand - the first "word", always either @botName, or /command
messageText - the ENTIRE message text, ie "/btc shop consumables"
	- use python's string.split() method to get each individual word
	- ie l = messageText.split() #now l = ["/btc", "shop", "consumables"]
	- l[0] = "/btc"
	- usage: "/items 5"
	- int(messageText.split()[1]), returns 5
update - the ENTIRE message update, used for fancy things
instanceAge - used in ATB for /age, can probably ignore

python dict:
myDict[7823645892] = 'hi'
myDict[...], will return 'hi'
I use this with chat_ids, which are unique to chats.

Thus, chatInstanceArray[chat_id]
Defined in each chat as (by default):
{'checking': True}
to add things (ie, a count variable), add this:
{'checking': True, 'count': 0}

Now, this is only saved as long as the bot is running. If you want to save past that,
save to a csv or something.

reference count like: chatInstanceArray[chat_id]['count']
